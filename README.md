# ZoomTest
Test application to demonstrate UIScrollView zooming bug in iOS 12

You need to use Xcode 10 beta to build this app.

If you run it on an iOS 11.4 simulator, it works fine. The image appears, centered in the scroll view and you can zoom and scroll

If you run it on an iOS 12.0 simulatore, it is totally broken. The image does not even appear in the scroll view.
